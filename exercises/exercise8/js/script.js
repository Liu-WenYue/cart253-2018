Final Project Prototype
Liu WenYue

This game is a Push the Box kind of game, where the player not pushing any
items but he has to reach at his partner before his partner disappears.
For every step the player moved, there will be health lost (reduce opacity)
for the partner. Player have to reach to his partner before the partner is
totally disappeared.

There will be 5 stages in this game. Each stage will be in different seasons
(winter, spring, summer, autumn and winter) and the characters will change
age for every stage. The first stage is a tutorial stage for the player to
understand how to play the game. For the second, third and fourth, there will
be obstacles on the way, for instance, “toys” for the second stage, “other
female characters” for the third stage and “diseases triggers” for the fourth
stage. If the player touched any of the obstacles, game overs and an option
for restart the stage will appear. There will also be items on the way to
stop the health lost of the partner for three moves, the items will be “candy”,
“ring” and “flowers”. For the final stage, there will not be any obstacles,
but the player and the partner will both loss health as the player moves.

Moreover, for all the stages, I will be adding more props to make the scene
more lively.

In this second prototype, I will doing the second stage of the game. The main
purpose of this second prototype is to make the additional items works in the
game,  refine the style of the assets used in the game.  The second stage of
the game will have the characters in their teenage time and the background is
in spring. The map for this stage is definitely harder than the first stage.
There will be “toys” on the way to prevent the player from reaching to his
partner, if the player moved onto the “toy”, gameover will be triggered; there
are also “candys”, if the player moved onto the “candy”, they can move three
moved without losing their partner’s health.

The player will be able to move with the arrow keys.
