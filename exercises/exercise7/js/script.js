Final Project Prototype
Liu WenYue

This game is a Push the Box kind of game, where the player not pushing any
items but he has to reach at his partner before his partner disappears.
For every step the player moved, there will be health lost (reduce opacity)
for the partner. Player have to reach to his partner before the partner is
totally disappeared.

There will be 5 stages in this game. Each stage will be in different seasons
(winter, spring, summer, autumn and winter) and the characters will change age
for every stage. The first stage is a tutorial stage for the player to
understand how to play the game. For the second, third and fourth, there will
be obstacles on the way, for instance, “toys” for the second stage, “other
female characters” for the third stage and “diseases triggers” for the fourth
stage. If the player touched any of the obstacles, game overs and an option
for restart the stage will appear. There will also be items on the way to stop
the health lost of the partner for three moves, the items will be “candy”,
“ring” and “flowers”.

For the final stage, there will not be any obstacles, but the player and the
partner will both loss health as the player moves.


In this first prototype, I will be doing the first stage of the game. The
main purpose of this first prototype is to get the art style, basic functions
and background music of the game ready. As this is the first stage of the game,
it’s more like a tutorial stage for the player to understand how to play the
game, the player just have to go straight to reach his partner and there will
not be any obstacles yet. During the game, there will be some text instructions,
and there will also be starting page and game over page.

The player will be able to move with the arrow keys.
